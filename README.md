# 📊 Statistics for Data Scientists with Python

A hands-on and professional study journey based on the book  
**_Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts_**  
by *Peter Bruce* and *Andrew Bruce*

This repository translates key statistical concepts into **real-world Python implementations**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as both a **learning log** and a **technical showcase**, designed to:
- Solidify foundational knowledge in applied statistics
- Build a professional portfolio using real logs and datasets
- Explore statistical thinking through code and visualizations
- Apply each topic to real-world cases (e.g., incidents, SLIs/SLOs, system behavior)
- Use tools such as Poetry, MkDocs, and Taskipy for reproducibility and structure

---

## ⚙️ Tools and Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)**: dependency and virtual environment management
- **[Taskipy](https://pypi.org/project/taskipy/)**: task automation (`mkdocs`, notebooks)
- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: project documentation
- **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**: analysis and visualizations
