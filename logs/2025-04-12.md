## Chapter
1 â€” Categorical, Correlation & Multivariate Analysis

## Dataset
Structured Apache logs from LogHub  
Source: https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/Apache

## Concepts Studied
- Categorical variable analysis (Level, EventTemplate)
- Mode, expected value approximation
- Visual encodings: bar plots, pie charts
- Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation
- Scatterplot: Hour vs Log Line ID
- Contingency tables
- Hexbin and violin plots

## Actions
- Explored `Level` and `EventTemplate` columns to detect dominant log structures
- Calculated mode and built frequency distributions
- Applied three correlation metrics between `Hour` and `LineId`
- Visualized temporal patterns using scatterplot and heatmaps
- Created contingency tables for multivariate insights
- Built density visualizations with hexbin and violin plots

## Conclusions
- The system logs are skewed toward the `notice` level, with `error` events concentrated in a few EventIds.
- There is a moderate correlation between `Hour` and `LineId`, indicating log accumulation during the day.
- The top templates are strongly skewed, which may distort observability signals.
- Violin and hexbin plots helped uncover hourly activity variation and visual complexity in event flow.

## Observability Takeaways
- Distributions should inform log filtering strategies.
- Correlation with time may help in building hour-aware alert baselines.
- Combining categorical structure with volume can reduce blind spots in dashboards.

## Next Steps
- Begin hypothesis testing and statistical inference in Chapter 2.
