## Chapter
1 — Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Taxonomy

## Dataset
Structured Apache logs from LogHub  
Source: https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/Apache

## Concepts Studied
- EDA: first look at structured log data
- Data type inspection and optimization
- Pandas dtype taxonomy and performance impact
- Temporal feature engineering (Hour, DayOfWeek)
- Performance benchmark: object vs. categorical dtype
- Visualization: hourly distribution, weekday usage

## Actions
- Loaded structured logs directly from GitHub
- Analyzed column types and optimized with `category`
- Created time-derived columns for grouping
- Benchmarked mean calculation speed by dtype
- Aggregated log volume by hour and day of week
- Built bar and line plots to visualize patterns

## Conclusions
- Object columns can drastically slow down calculations
- Converting to `category` improves both performance and memory
- Apache logs are concentrated around specific hours and days
- Temporal patterns are crucial for future correlation and anomaly detection

## Observability Takeaways
- Data preprocessing (e.g., type casting) directly impacts monitoring scalability
- Temporal features are first-class citizens in platform telemetry
- EDA is not just for exploration — it is a foundation for SRE-aware modeling

## Next Steps
- Apply statistical estimators to quantify log variability across time (Day 2)
