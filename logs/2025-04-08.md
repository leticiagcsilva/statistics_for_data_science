## Chapter
1 â€” Exploratory Data Analysis

1.1 - Data Taxonomy and simple EDA

## Focus of the Day
- Understanding data taxonomy (statistical types vs pandas types)
- Measuring the impact of correct typing on performance and memory
- Using category dtype vs object in pandas
- Improving read performance with dtype optimization

## Actions
- Created notebook `taxonomy_and_performance.ipynb`
- Demonstrated memory savings using `category` over `object`
- Simulated performance gains when loading large CSV files using optimized dtypes
